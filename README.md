# password_generator

## Description

The password generator is one step on the road to help me to become a better developer than I was before. The password generator was built to help people have a more secure password that cannot be easily cracked and to help with the use of Math library and how to use pop up events in Javascript. This helped to reinforce my knowlege of using javascript elements inside of a webpage.
